Organize Django settings into multiple files and directories. Easily
override and modify settings. Use wildcards in settings file paths
and mark settings files as optional.

Requirements
------------

While this package will most likely work with the most versions of ``django``, we do not officially support any versions except the latest release and the current LTS version, which are ``1.11`` and ``2.0`` right now.

This package has no dependencies itself.


Installation
------------

Install by using ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install django-split-settings

We also recommend to try `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/>`_ to handle dependencies.


Usage
-----

Replace your existing ``settings.py`` with a list of components that
make up your Django settings. Preferably create a settings package
that contains all the files.

Here's a minimal example:

.. code:: python

    from split_settings.tools import optional, include

    include(
        'components/base.py',
        'components/database.py',
        optional('local_settings.py')
    )

In the example, the files ``base.py`` and ``database.py`` are included
in that order from the subdirectory called ``components/``.
``local_settings.py`` in the same directory is included if it exists.

**Note:** The local context is passed on to each file, so each
following file can access and modify the settings declared in the
previous files.

We also made a in-depth `tutorial`_.

Tips and tricks
---------------

You can use wildcards in file paths:

.. code:: python

    include('components/my_app/*.py')

Note that files are included in the order that ``glob`` returns them,
probably in the same order as what ``ls -U`` would list them. The
files are NOT in alphabetical order.
